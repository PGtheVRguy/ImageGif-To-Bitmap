Notice!

Please run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" to run this shit


run it like this

"python3 convert.py [filename]"

It is recommended to leave the file in the same directory as the program

Add "--no-preview" to the end of the line if you want no ascii preview!



If there are any issues, please report to the GitHub. This was made in an hour during my Spanish class.
